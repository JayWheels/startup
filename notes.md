# Something about this being able to be used on the test :eyes:

While I did learn a lot from this assignment, I was not able to finish the part about resolving conflicts, becasue it asked us to change the conflictTest.md file from within GitHub in order to manually create a conflict. Well, at least in the google chrome browser I was using, there is no option to edit in-browser. However, I was able to read through the notes and get the general idea from what situations would normally cause that an dwhat I would do to fix it.
